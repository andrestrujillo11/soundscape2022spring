The Winter Walk Preview:

In this preview, so far what I have recorded is footsteps walking on snow because that is the main focus of the story, and mp3 files of wind, and some music track that I got from multiple sources online. The story takes place in the winter, and I want to make that as clear as possible.

NOTE: I plan on recording and adding some audio beforehand indicating why the college student, the main character (voiced by me), decides to go on a walk during the winter.

Now, I will go more into depth about the three audio clips I currently have as of right now.

- The first is me walking on snow, recorded by me. This is the most necessary part of the story in my eyes. This is because as previously mentioned, the story is centered around the college student walking in the winter. I may end up re-recording this, or editing it a little more, but it is definitely the most important sound in this project.

- The second is an audio file I got off freesound. This file is called "swirling winter wind gusty grains sand" posted by kyles. Because my story takes place in the winter, I want to make it extremely clear to the listener that it is cold outside, and providing a windy sound aids in doing so. Below is the link to this audio file:

- The third is a music track called "winter-wind" posted by wi-photos on freesound.  I alway feel as though including music is vital to most, if not any sort of audio, or visual project. It adds so much more to the feel of the story and makes what the author wants to portray much easier to visualize to the audience. So, because this story takes place in the winter, I felt that including some background music that had a wintery feel was nothing but essential. Below is the link to this audio file:
