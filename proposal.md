For my audio narrative, I'm in between "a day in the life" or a potential story I came up with while lying in bed. I plan on this story taking place at a park. What I've come up with so far is a young college student going on a peaceful nature walk at the park in the winter. However, to make things "spicy", as they are walking, they hear a nearby branch crack and look back and see a humanoid shadow and so they begin to pick up the pace. I've yet to decide where I want to go from there with that story, but I want to leave it open-ended for now because there are many possibilities.
