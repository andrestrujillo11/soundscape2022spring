# The Winter Walk

** This is essentially a written version of the audio narrative **

The college student is a generally stressed kid. He usually is overloaded with work, and never seems to have free time. In the event that he does manage to find some free time, he enjoys going on walks. He loves walking in the outdoors, rain or shine, hot or cold, night or day. He loves walking because it relieves his stress. Walking is therapeutic to him because it allows him to become one with nature and to not have a care in the world but admiring the beautiful earth. At college, the student's go-to walking location is a nearby park with a large soccer field, some playgrounds, and a long trail. Whenever he has no schoolwork, that is where is goes.

It is now a cold and early Saturday morning in December and the student has just woken up. Last night, he just finished a big programming assignment. He also finished all the other homework he had from his other classes before he went to bad last night, sacrificing a night out with friends. However, that does not matter as he now has as much free time as he desires. So, the first thing he decides to do with that free time is go on a walk.

The student: "Ahhh, finally some free time. A nature walk is long overdue."

The student then puts on his jacket and opens the door to leave the apartment. His roommate had also just woken up as he opened the door.

The roommate: "Where you going?"

The student: "Boutta go on a walk at the park."

The roommate: "It's literally 7 degrees outside!"

The student: "Haha I know I know, but you know I love my walks."

The roommate: "That's true. Have fun."

The student: "See ya."

The student then closes the door begins his walk to the park. He is greeted by the ground covered in snow and freezing cold wind blowing on his face. It is cold, but he doesn't mind. He simply wants to walk.

After a short amount of time, he makes it to the park and he hears lots of birds chirping. He assumes it's all the stragglers migrating south because of the cold. He then finally gets to walk at his go-to place. He walks for a bit and then hears a branch crack behind him. He looks behind him, and can barely make out what seems to be a large humanoid shadowy figure.

He sees the mysterious figure grow bigger and get closer to him, so he begins to pick up the pace and start running. He runs for some time and eventually trips, falls, and faints.

He then wakes up, initially hearing what sounds like a monster's voice. As the voice is speaking, and the student fully regains consciousness, that voice turned out to be the voice of his friend.

The voice: "Dude. Dude. Dude!"

The student sees his good friend's face looking down at him.

The student: "Huh? Oh, hey buddy."

The friend: "Yoo, are you alright bro? Seems like you slipped on some ice."

The student: "Huh, I guess so. Last thing I remember was someone or some thing chasing me."

The friend: "Haha, yeah that thing just happened to be me."

The student: "Well, why the heck were you lurking in the woods and chasing me?"

The friend: "Remember that one time you pranked me and said you weren't in my living room and then I went downstairs and then you scared me?"

The student: "Uhhh Yeahhhhh."

The friend: "Well, consider this payback."

The student: "Fair enough."

The friend: "You wanna go back to campus and grab some sandwiches?"

The student: "Yeah, I'm game. Lets do it!"

The two then begin their walk in the snow back to campus.
